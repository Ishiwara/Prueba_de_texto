Perceptual decisions arise from the activity of
neurons distributed across brain circuits. But, decoding
the mechanisms behind this cognitive operation
across brain circuits has long posed a difficult
problem.Werecorded the neuronal activity of diverse
cortical areas, while monkeys performed a vibrotactile
discrimination task. We find that the encoding of
the stimuli during the stimulus periods, working
memory, and comparison periods is widely distributed
across cortical areas. Notably, during the
comparison and postponed decision report periods
the activity of frontal brain circuits encode both the
result of the sensory evaluation that corresponds to
the monkeyâ€™s possible choices and past information
on which the decision is based. These results suggest
that frontal lobe circuits are more engaged in
the readout of sensory information from working
memory, when it is required to be compared with
other sensory inputs, than simply engaged in motor
responses during this task.
